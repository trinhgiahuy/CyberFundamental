Shared secret is an InfoSec term that usually refers to
A RESULT OF PROTOCOLS LIKE IKE (INTERNET KEY EXCHANGE) OF IPSEC.
personal sensitive data that cannot be only private but must be known to someone else, too, than the owner.
the random bit sequences that two parties send to a trusted server for the purpose of authenticating each other.
the commands and passwords that allow a backdoor entry to an information system by a group of hackers.

The central meaning of data protection is in protecting
the secret information of individuals.
THE INFORMATION THAT INDIVIDUALS DISCLOSE TO DIFFERENT DATA COLLECTORS.
the confidential information of companies.
the information companies provide to various data collectors.

GDPR defines several roles with respect to a person's personal data, but not the role of data
subject.
OBJECT.
controller.
processor.

Social media is a "lively place" and update is a buzzword there. What kind of update, however, is usually poorly handled?
LINKS TO SITES THAT HAVE PUBLISHED NEW PAGES THAT CORRECT EARLIER MISTAKES IN THEIR NEWS.
Changes in a user's profile or credentials.
Algorithms and software of the platform.
Memberships in groups.

Ethics is an important topic in information systems,
AND SOME ASPECTS OF IT EXTENDING TO THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY INCLUDE TREATMENT OF PRIVACY AND IPR.
and in information security its most vital application is in forecasting attacks by understanding the hackers' ethics.
but in information security its role is negligible with the exception of hacking aspects.
but in information security it only occurs in ethical hacking.


Which of the following is mainly a task that can be performed using a cryptographic protocol?
Secure storage of an encryption key.
Converting an email message to ciphertext.
Generating an encryption key based on good random numbers.
AGREEING ON AN ENCRYPTION KEY.


The term plaintext
means ASCII-text without any formatting or markup.
is used for human readable sequences of characters.
refers to documents that do not contain any executable content like macros.
IS A SYNONYM FOR CLEARTEXT AND THE CONCEPT IS USED IN CRYPTOGRAPHY.

Stream ciphers are one of the two classes of symmetric cryptographic methods, the other one being
cryptographic hashing.
public key cryptography.
authentication algorithms.
BLOCK ALGORITHMS

DES, the Digital Encryption Standard, was for a long time the state-of-the-art method to
carry out the exchange of cryptographic keys.
authenticate the owner of the secret encryption key.
PRODUCE CONFIDENTIALITY OF COMMUNICATIONS.
transform digital images to contain a watermark.


Which of the following does not apply?
IF THE RSA DECRYPTION EXPONENT IS D, THEN THE RSA DECRYPTION PROGRAM HAS TO DO D-1 MODULAR MULTIPLICATIONS.
The RSA decryption algorithm does not need to know the two prime numbers that make up the modulus n.
An RSA signature can be made even if you do not know the two prime numbers that make up the public modulus n.
If you raise a number x smaller than the RSA modulus n to the public RSA exponent (e) and then to the private exponent (d) and only then reduce the result modulo n, you obtain x.


Which of the following does not apply?
If you raise a number x smaller than the RSA modulus n to the private RSA exponent (d) and then to the public exponent (e) and only then reduce the result modulo n, you obtain x.
The RSA decryption algorithm does not need to know the two prime numbers that make up the modulus n.
AN RSA SIGNATURE CANNOT BE MADE UNLESS YOU KNOW THE TWO PRIME NUMBERS THAT MAKE UP THE PUBLIC MODULUS N.
RSA encryption can be calculated for a larger number than the public modulus, but decryption still produces a smaller number than the modulus.

IPSEC
PROVIDES MECHANISMS FOR AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION.
only authenticates clients toward a server.
can only be deployed with IPv6.
provides mechanisms for nonrepudiation.

What does key exchange mean in the sentence: "Key exchange is one of the most important cryptographic protocols."?
A public key is revoked and replaced by a new one which is authenticated.
The parties authenticate their public keys to each other.
An old symmetric key is being updated.
A SYMMETRIC KEY IS AGREED UPON.

TLS is a very common cryptographic protocol. The T in its name comes from the word
trusted.
transmission.
TRANSPORT.
total.

The tasks of a packet filter may include
user authentication.
anti-virus.
spam filtering.
WRITING LOGS

One possible action of IPsec is to add to each data packet a field with
a signature calculated from the packet with the sender's key.
the sender's public key and its certificate.
a certificate calculated from header fields of the packet.
A HASH CALCULATED FROM THE PACKET AND A SYMMETRIC KEY.

Which of the following is more important in a VPN that must meet the security needs of the network connection for a remote worker?
virtuality
ENCRYPTION
transparent functionality of the network
tunneling, and hiding the endpoints

In the cell phone system the network authenticates the phone or actually the SIM card in it. What mechanism is in place here?
One-time password
CHALLENGE-RESPONSE METHOD, WITH A SYMMETRIC KEY SYSTEM.
Fixed password
Challenge-response method that applies a public key system.

The mobile phone systems 2G, 3G, 4G, ... authenticate the subscriber
with a PKI based protocol.
by using an authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
by encrypting and transmitting a shared secret from the SIM card to the network.
BY APPLYING A CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTION TO A SHARED SECRET

What is not used as a term for the act of a computer system making a new entry to the log file of active users?
log in
PASS IN
sign in
log on

Single sign-on is characterized by the fact that
the user has a different ID for different services, even though the password he or she must remember for them is the same.
there is no need to store log information about the use and operation of the services elsewhere than in a centralized login service.
the password a user must remember is different for different services, even if the username for each is the same.
SECURITY IS IMPROVED COMPARED TO A USER HAVING THE SAME PASSWORD FOR MULTIPLE SERVICES.

Password salt is
the small variation allowed in password systems that use very long passphrases.
the method to make fixed passwords variable by requiring to insert time dependent punctuations.
the secret constant that a password checking procedure uses as an input together with the password.
THE RANDOM NUMBER STORED WITHOUT ENCRYPTION TOGETHER WITH EACH HASHED PASSWORD
