Advanced persistent threat refers to
a vulnerability that has not been patched.
A THREAT ACTOR WITH PLENTIFUL RESOURCES WHO HAS GAINED UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO AN INFORMATION SYSTEM AND STAYS UNDETECTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.
a Trojan horse that applies some novel method to compromise the system where it is residing.
a zero-day vulnerability, which the finder has sold to some party other than the manufacturer or vendor who is responsible for patching it.

**A root kit is
a term referring to methods of breaking the limitations of the OS for installing programs from various sources.
is a set of tools for breaking the DRM limitations of multimedia software with respect to viewing, copying and modifying content.
A COLLECTION OF SOFTWARE TOOLS WHICH - AFTER GETTING TO A COMPUTER - ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO ACCESS THE MACHINE WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES.
the common name for versions of a computer virus that attaches to one of the supervisor or kernel modules.

**None of the following is a definition of a buffer overflow, but which one best describes it?
The program counter, i.e. the address of the next instruction to be executed, is moved forward by one, even if it is already in the last instruction of the subroutine.
It is always a security threat because an attacker can use it to cause evil - at least a program crash.
A memory reference made by a program points to another process's memory area.
A NUMBER LARGER THAN THE ARRAY SIZE IS USED TO INDEX THE ARRAY, AND THE OPERATING SYSTEM DOES NOT BLOCK THIS REFERENCE.

**Assume a web site allows users to input data that other users retrieve later. If those data are not intended to be exec**uted by the retrieving browsers, but this still happens, the input validation has failed to prevent a
CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING.
cross-site request forgery.
malicious file execution.
database injection.

**A virus can do nothing if its code is just read but not run. Why then does the MS-Word macro virus start, even if the document containing it is only read from disk to Word?
AN INFECTED DOCUMENT CONTAINS PROGRAM CODE THAT WORD RUNS AFTER READING THE DOCUMENT.
The virus is memory-resident and infects documents when they are opened.
An infected document contains program code which, when read into Word, causes a buffer overflow in Word and ends up being executed after all.
The virus has also infected Word's program code.

**Threats to network communications can be summarized in five fundamental cases, one of which is the unauthorized use of a resource over the network. The other four deal with the "fate" of messages. If each of these four cases is seen as a breach of either confidentiality, integrity or availability, then there will be two cases breaching
INTEGRITY.
availability.
both confidentiality and availability.
both integrity and confidentiality.

**On which layer of the TCP/IP stack does routing operate?
Physical layer.
NETWORK LAYER.
Transport layer.
Data-link layer.

**Besides a physical meaning the concept of access control is defined as "The process of granting or denying specific requests to obtain and use information and related information processing services". What is the significance of the word "specific" here?
It denotes the fact that not all requests are submitted to the granting/denying process.
Without that word the defined scope would be overly large, covering all levels from the OS kernel to the application layer.
Omitting the word would not change the meaning, because all requests of the defined kind are specific in some sense.
IT LIMITS THE SCOPE OF ACCESS CONTROL TO THE MOMENT WHEN THE REQUEST HAPPENS - IN CONTRAST TO THE POLICY LEVEL THAT TELLS HOW THE GRANTING/DENYING PROCESS SHOULD WORK.

_________________________________
**Investigate the claim: As a security goal, Availability, or Usability, means that information or services are stored and accessible sooner or later. It is false because
the term usability should not be used in the same sense as the term availability.
AVAILABILITY REQUIRES THAT THE DATA BE ACCESSED WITHIN A SET TIME LIMIT.
in terms of security, availability only applies to information and usability only to services.
usability also requires that the data have not changed uncontrollably.

says that locks are for honest people.


**The security of a mechanism shall not be based on the secrecy of its design or implementation. This is the principle of an open model. Which of the following is an example of complying with this?
A corporate network is defended by a two-tier system in which the structure of the outer and less important part of the network is clearly visible to the attacker and can misdirect him into focusing on it.
The security system is assembled from so simple modules that everyone can be assured of the security of each of them.
ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE URLS ON A WEBSITE ARE LINKED ON A SITEMAP OR OTHER INDEX PAGE, BUT ALL NON-PUBLIC URLS REQUIRE A LOGIN.
The single sign-on mechanism that allows the user to access various web services works regardless of the service implementation platform.


**Encapsulation is a general protection idea whose applicability ranges from vaults to IPsec's encapsulating security payload (ESP), but which of the following is NOT another example of it?
INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
TCP wrapper
sandbox in Java Virtual Machine
a VPN tunnel

The ____ describes the rules that need to be implemented to ensure that the security requirements are met in your organization.
SECURITY POLICY
security model

What does accountability mean in the field of information security?
The users or their departments have to pay for the CPU and network usage, and logs are kept to enable this.
The users or their departments have to pay the costs of resolving security incidents caused by the users.
The userâ€™s actions in the information system are recorded in log files and they are used for evaluation of the user with respect to rewards or sanctions.
THE USERÂ€™S ACTIONS ARE LOGGED AND IN CASE OF SECURITY INCIDENCES IT WILL BE KNOWN WHETHER THE USER IS RESPONSIBLE OR NOT.

_________________________________ Randomness
**A pseudorandom number
is a random sequence of bits taken from some physical source, transformed to a number without filtering that would balance the set of such numbers to be evenly distributed.
is a bit sequence intended for cryptographic use but originating from a forged or accidentally false source that has destroyed its statistical properties.
IS A BINARY NUMBER WHOSE BITS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED WITH A KNOWN ALGORITHM FROM SOME INITIAL VALUE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SET OF SUCH NUMBERS PASSES CERTAIN STATISTICAL TESTS.
is a number taken from a long bit sequence, which is apparently a result of computation, but the algorithm is not known.


**Which of the following 64-bit strings is more likely to be generated by random.org, whose bits are very genuinely random?

**Is 154585821 a random number?
No, if the number appeared publicly somewhere else and the author of this question took it from there. Otherwise yes.
No, because it uses only 5 different digits although it is nine digits long.
No, because it repeats the digits 5 and 8 in such a way that is extremely improbable for this short a sequence of digits.
THE QUESTION CANNOT BE ANSWERED, BECAUSE RANDOMNESS IS NOT A PROPERTY OF A SINGLE NUMBER WITHOUT A CONTEXT.


**In the self-test of a random bit generator it needs to pass some statistical properties. What features are common?
The generator is started twice and the correlation of the generated queues must be within certain limits.
The generator is started from several specified initial states and the generated queues must be the same as the reference data.
The generated bits are correlated with previously stored queues and the results must be within certain limits.
THE NUMBER OF ONES MUST BE WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF RUNS OF CERTAIN LENGTHS.


_________________________________ Key space
**Key escrow
means an attacker's method of cracking encryption without cryptologic means.
IS ALSO POSSIBLE IN THE PUBLIC KEY SYSTEM.
is what happens if the key owner stores it encrypted with his own master key.

**Only one of the following may need to be negotiated when agreeing on symmetric encryption. What?
ALGORITHM VERSION
key modifying salt value
padding length
initialization vector


**How much bigger is the key space of AES-128 than the address space of a 64-bit operating system?
Two times larger.
THE KEY SPACE SIZE EQUALS THE ADDRESS SPACE SIZE SQUARED.
64 times larger.
It is not bigger but just 1/4 of the address space because the 64-bit memory consists of 8-bit bytes.


**Updating encryption keys quite often is important. The main reason is
to make a chosen-plaintext attack impossible.
TO KEEP THE AMOUNT OF TEXT ENCRYPTED WITH THE SAME KEY REASONABLE.
to make it more difficult for a cracker to derive a new key based on an already revealed old key.
to prevent the updated encryption program from using the same key as the old one.


**What is not true of a session key?
It cannot be a public key.
It is a symmetric key but it need not be the same to both directions, i.e. one party may use it only for encryption and the other one for decryption.
ITS PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT THOSE KEYS THAT ARE CHANGED FOR EACH MESSAGE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS.
A leaked session key should not expose the keys of any previous or subsequent sessions.

_________________________________ Modes of encryption
**What is a digital envelope?

**A block cipher is usually not operated in the simple mode of an Electronic Code Book. What can NOT be achieved with the other modes in contrast to the ECB?
message authentication
resilience against frequency analysis

ELECTRONIC CODE BOOK.
Electronic Cipher Block.
Encrypting Chain of Blocks.
Encrypting Code Block.


**Symmetric encryption mode CBC comes from the words
Code Book Cipher.
CIPHER BLOCK CHAINING.
Crypto Block Cipher.
Cook Book of Codes.


**How do the symmetric encryption modes ECB and CBC differ?
One uses a different key for decryption than for encryption, the other does not.
In one the cryptotext is longer than the plaintext, in the other not.
One can only be used for block and the other for stream algorithms.
IN ONE, A CERTAIN BIT OF PLAINTEXT AFFECTS MORE BITS OF CRYPTOTEXT THAN IN THE OTHER.

_________________________________ Encrypting or signing
**The RSA signature is simple based on the RSA encryption formula because
IT ONLY EXCHANGES THE ROLES OF THE DECRYPTION EXPONENT AND THE ENCRYPTION EXPONENT.
the modulus becomes the private key and both exponents become the public key.
it only replaces squaring with taking a square root.
both exponents become the private key and the prime factors of the modulus become the public key.


**Why is a typical symmetric encryption-decryption algorithm not good for signatures?
The keys are too short for long-term use.
Verifying the signature would be too laborious.
It cannot be used to create a digital envelope.
VERIFICATION WOULD BE DONE WITH THE SAME KEY AS THE SIGNATURE.

_________________________________ Trapdoor
**The concept of a trapdoor in a public key cryptosystem refers to
the decryption key or the signature generation key.
A STRUCTURE IN A PUBLIC KEY THAT WOULD BE EASY TO CHECK IF YOU KNEW COMPONENTS THAT ARE ONLY KNOWN BY THE CREATOR OF THE KEY.
an algorithm for calculating discrete logarithms modulo n when n is a product of two large primes.
a way to perform public key encryption operations without knowing the keys.


**A common trapdoor in public key cryptosystems is
the ability to compute a discrete logarithm with respect to a large prime number.
the ability to calculate a discrete logarithm with respect to the product of two prime numbers.
TO KNOW THE FACTORS OF A LARGE INTEGER, WHICH IS A PRODUCT OF TWO DIFFERENT PRIMES.
to know the square root of a large integer, which is a square of a prime number.


**When two very large prime numbers are multiplied, the product can be published without revealing the prime numbers,
as long as the product is first reduced by taking its remainder with respect to a third prime number.
but the least significant bits up to the first zero should be omitted.
EVEN IF YOU KNOW HOW MANY BITS THERE ARE IN THOSE PRIMES.
even if the square of the second prime number were also made public.

_________________________________ Hashing and MACing
**Which of the following hacking methods is mainly related to a keyless crypto algorithm?
differential analysis

A one-way hash is calculated as the last step of producing a signature.
Compression is not usually used for signing.
THE ASYMMETRIC SIGNATURE ALGORITHM IS NOT APPLIED TO A DOCUMENT BUT TO ITS ONE-WAY HASH.

_________________________________ Inside a protocol
**What is a property of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol?
BOTH PARTIES RAISE THE BASE G TO A POWER MODULO P, AND THE RESULT IS COMMUNICATED TO THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER ONE WILL COME TO KNOW WHAT THE EXPONENT USED BY THE OTHER PARTY WAS.
One party invents a prime p and the other a prime q. The product n of these large numbers is the public key that acts as the key exchange modulus.
If calculating discrete logarithms modulo a large prime number is indeed a difficult problem (as is generally believed), the DH protocol provides the protocol participants with the same key that no one else knows.
In order to include authentication, the parties must first secretly agree on the modulus p and the base g.


**Diffie-Hellman is the name of
a powerful method of breaking ciphers prior to AES.
a protocol for remotely creating a mutual digital signature on a document.
the first public key encryption method.
A METHOD TO CREATE KEYS FOR SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION BETWEEN TWO REMOTE PARTIES.

_________________________________ Water and fire
**If dust and dirt need to be taken into account in any way when surveying security threats, which of the following has the least to do with it?
Jamming of mechanical parts of computer equipment
TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
Overheating
Absences due to dust allergies


**Consider the claim: "Even an IT work environment produces dust that, when accumulated, can cause short circuits in computing devices." The claim is
true because there are people in the work environment and therefore dust that conducts electricity.
FALSE BECAUSE DUST IN A NORMAL WORK ENVIRONMENT DOES NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY.
false because the hardware fans are built to prevent dust from accumulating in the wrong places.
true because the static electricity of IT equipment collects dust specifically in the wrong places.


**When developing preparedness for serious fires it is good to assign tasks to personnel. Which of the following is a more important task than others in this respect?
Preparation of applications for compensation to an insurance company.
Various tasks of informing customers and authorities.
ACTIONS TO DRIVE DOWN OR MOVE COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND MEDIA TO SAFETY.
Clearance actions to be taken as soon as the fire department has given permission.


**This course covers a set of natural, somewhat human-independent threats to information security. They do not deserve a very extensive treatment, at least on a basic course, because
the control mechanisms required are remarkably complex.
COMBATING SUCH THREATS OR THEIR EFFECTS IS USUALLY NECESSARY ALSO FOR REASONS OTHER THAN SECURITY.
only human-dependent security threats can be handled properly.
the risk level of such threats to security is quite low.


**Consider the claim: "A key way to combat water hazards for computing is the water insulation of hardware rooms." The claim is
false, because the hardware does not work properly in too dry air.
true, because there are not even other ways to combat the effect of water.
true, because waterproofing is the easiest way to protect equipment in a room from water.
FALSE, BECAUSE OTHER MEANS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND CHEAPER.


**Water can be thought of coming into contact with equipment from four directions: bottom, side, top and diffusely in air. How many of these should be considered in security planning and how?
ALL BUT THE SAME CONTROL MECHANISM DOES NOT WORK FOR ALL.
Only the most serious direction, as the probability is very small anyway.
Three, each with a different security mechanism.
None, as water should not get anywhere near the equipment.

**Which of the following applies?
From the perspective of a computing device alone, power outages are not among attacks to be prevented.

_________________________________ Firewall
**What is the most likely reason if a firewall installed between an internal and external network allows an attack from the exterior to systems on the intranet?
THE INTRANET POLICY IS INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED IN THE FIREWALL.
The intranet policy allows such attacks.
An error has occurred in the manufacture of the hardware or software of the firewall.
The integrity of the hardware or software of the firewall is broken .

Send an alert to the intrusion detection system.
Treat the next packet with a different rule.
WRITE PACKET TAGS TO A LOG FILE.
Give the user a warning.

**How do IPsec's AH and ESP protocols relate to key exchange?
KEYS MUST BE AGREED BEFORE THESE PROTOCOLS START.
The protocols operate using the public keys that are valid at the current time.
It is possible to inform about the used keys afterwards.
These protocols have built-in key exchange operations.


**If both TLS and IPsec (either AH or ESP) are applied to the same outgoing data, then at the time when IPsec operates on the data,
they contain fields modified by TLS for which IPsec performs its own operations but using TLS keys.
they contain fields modified by TLS for which IPsec does nothing.
there is no trace of modifications made by TLS yet.
THERE ARE TLS-MODIFIED FIELDS FOR WHICH IPSEC PERFORMS ITS OWN OPERATIONS REGARDLESS OF THE CONTENTS OF THE FIELDS.


**If the same outgoing data is encrypted with both SSH and IPsec, then at the time when IPsec operates on the data,
they contain fields modified by SSH for which IPsec performs its own operations but using SSH keys.
THERE ARE FIELDS MODIFIED BY SSH FOR WHICH IPSEC PERFORMS ITS OWN OPERATIONS REGARDLESS OF SSH KEYS.
there are fields modified by SSH for which IPsec does nothing.

_________________________________ TLS
**Investigate the claim: "The certificate sent by a server can be installed in the browser so that
TLS can use it to verify the private key of the same server in the future." The claim is

true and does not require a browser restart.
true, but the browser needs to be shut down and restarted.
false, because you can install public keys but not certificates in your browser.
FALSE, AS TLS DOES NOT VERIFY THE SERVER'S PRIVATE KEY BUT THE SIGNATURE MADE WITH THAT PRIVATE KEY.


**Because TLS works below the application layer, it does not know what kind of data it protects. Nevertheless,
both server and browser authentication are always part of the security services it provides.
IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MORE THAN TWO PARTIES.
it does not provide protection for the identity of the user of the client machine.
it can protect a bank transfer on an e-commerce site without a new key exchange.

_________________________________ DNS,SSH

**The domain name system, DNS,
is necessary for the operation of the web.
is constantly under DoS and spoofing attacks which cause the majority of downtime for internet users.
HAS THE SECURITY EXTENSION DNSSEC, BUT EVEN THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE CONFIDENTIALITY TO THE DNS QUERIES.
has the shortcoming that it cannot be implemented within a single organization for internal use.

**Suppose someone has installed SSH on her own machine and has already used it to log on to the target machine. 
Which of the following is necessary in all cases to allow the next login with SSH? She or her own machine must have

HER OWN PRIVATE KEY OR HER OWN PASSWORD FOR THE TARGET MACHINE.
the private or public key of the target machine.
her own private or public key.
the private key of her own or of the target machine.

_________________________________ Application layer
**In Kerberos, the user's password

**What is the difference between the security needs of remote access to (i) a host computer and (ii) a server?
IN ONE OF THEM THE USER HAS ACCESS TO RESOURCES ONLY THROUGH A LIMITED PROCESS, IN THE OTHER MORE BROADLY.
In one of them, users rarely have such resources of their own that several other users would not also have access to.
One of them seldom requires such encryption, where the key is different for different users.
The difference in use is so small that it does not make sense to differentiate between protection needs.

**Assume that one employee of a company needs to access files and programs on a mainframe computer from his home computer.
Which of the following is a better design for this than the others?

Implementing work via a TLS-secured web server instead of a terminal connection.
The current-day PC's are powerful enough. So, set up the programs and files on the employee's home computer locally.
A network that has been made private with virtualization.
AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION BETWEEN ENDPOINTS.


**Tunnels securing remote connections can be established
only at the network or link layer, and the usual network connection protocols are not sufficient for this.
BOTH AT THE APPLICATION LAYER WITHIN NETWORK CONNECTIONS AND AT THE NETWORK LEVEL AROUND APPLICATION LAYER MESSAGES.
only below the application layer on the transport or network layer.
with the same protocols as the network connections between your own machine and the service provider, i.e. with PPP, for example.

An earlier successfully broken DRM signal in an attempt to get access to new media content.


**When a user authenticates to a server, the ensuing service will use some identifiers. 
If these are not protected well, it may happen that someone else takes them into use and drops the user out. What is this situation called?

man-in-the-middle
replay attack
denial of service
SESSION HIJACKING

**When the cell phone network (2/3/4G) authenticates a caller outside the area of the caller's home location register (HLR), it uses the mobility management service local to the caller. Let us denote this service by VLR (visitor location register, as in 2/3G). What is then known about the key K on the SIM card?
A hash computed from it and the timestamp is available to the VLR for a certain time.
The VLR uses K to check the response to the challenge it sent to the caller's phone.
A copy of the key is known to the VLR, but the key is changed for the next call.
THE VLR CHECKS THE RESPONSE FROM THE CALLER'S PHONE TO THE AUTHENTICATION CHALLENGE BY COMPARING THE RESPONSE TO A VALUE CALCULATED IN ADVANCE USING K

**Assume you are using a multi-user computer running Unix or Linux. What happens when you issue the command 'logout'?
A LOT MORE DATA WILL BE DELETED FROM THE SYSTEM THAN YOUR USERNAME FROM THE LIST OF ACTIVE USERS.
You will be wiped away from the list of the active users, but other non-admin users could not find this out.
All your processes will be terminated and you cannot run any commands on the computer before you login again.
Other users get a notification that you have left the system.

The rights have changed and they would no longer allow such activities.
A signature gets accepted even if it was not made by the person in whose name it was made.
A terminal session gets used by someone other than the one who was logged in.
THE INFORMATION IS NO LONGER RELEVANT TO THE PERSON WHO HAS ACCESS TO IT, AND INDIFFERENCE MAKES HIM OR HER CARELESS ABOUT ITS CONFIDENTIALITY.

_________________________________ Secure Programming
**Depending on how a program is written and what it needs to do, it may require more or less access rights than its user has. How should the programmer deal with administrator privileges?
If the program needs them, the program must be entirely based on them.
If needed, they should be used only during the startup phase of the program.
It is not recommended that they be required.
FOR THOSE PARTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT NEED THEM, FORMAL VERIFICATION IS RECOMMENDABLE.

**Depending on how a program is written and what it needs to do, it may require more or less access rights than its user has. How should the programmer deal with administrator privileges?
It suffices that non-administrators are able to use the program.
They are never needed at run-time, but they can be temporarily used in access control during the compilation and testing phase.
If a program has components that need them, it is recommended that the other components be protected with wrapper technology.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROGRAM BE BUILT TO OPERATE WITH LESSER RIGHTS.


**Trusting user input is detrimental. This is one of the fundaments for secure programming. Among the following five rules, 
which two are applications of it? (I) PROTECT AGAINST BUFFER OVERFLOWS. (II) DISABLE WEB SITE SCRIPTING. 
(iii) Do not require administrator privileges. (iv) Leave the generation of the encryption code to professionals. (v) Reduce attack targets.

(iv) & (v)
(I) & (II)
(iii) & (iv)
(ii) & (iii)


**One fundamental rule of secure programming is "Reduce attack targets." It mainly means that
the program is able to operate with as few different levels of privileges as possible.
minimal number of names and addresses of other programs, services and sites are stored in the program.
the program receives as little input from the user as possible.
LITTLE-USED FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM ARE INACTIVE BY DEFAULT.

**Some features of downloaded software can be verified by signatures provided by Verisign, for example, but these only guarantee that the
code manufacturer takes responsibility for any security issues.
software corresponds to its specifications.
code passed a virus scan, albeit by several different methods.
CODE ORIGIN AND INTEGRITY ARE CORRECT.


**What is the strongest method to assure users that the update of their existing program that they are downloading originates from where it should?
TLS
CODE SIGNING
MAC (message authentication code)
fingerprinting

but its user can easily corrupt its trustworthiness.

_________________________________ Deletion
**Destroying a file with multiple overwrites does not necessarily guarantee that the information contained in the file could not yet be obtained by unauthorized persons. If a leak occurs, which of the following is the most likely cause?
An attacker has inserted a Trojan horse to the overwrite program that copies and sends the data before its normal operation.
AN ATTACKER FIRST OBTAINS A FILE NAME FROM AN ARCHIVED LIST AND THEN MANAGES TO FIND A COPY OF THE FILE ON SOME OTHER STORAGE MEDIUM.
The overwrite program does not reach all the file storage blocks on the disk due to a malfunction of the file manager.
Even when overwritten, the magnetic field used to store the original data is exposed by special devices.


**There are three degrees in getting rid of a file, depending on what is needed to still access the file: a file manager, a special system program, or an electronics lab. Which of these can access information that is called residual data?
not any
JUST A LAB OR A SYSTEM PROGRAM
all
just a lab


**The type of overwriting that is related to erasing data
does not apply to valid data but applies to residual data.
PREVENTS ANY DATA FROM BECOMING RESIDUAL DATA.
uses residual data as its input.
produces residual data.

**Bit rot
is another name of ransomware.
IS EXEMPLIFIED BY DEGRADATION OF ELECTRIC CHARGE ON SOLID-STATE MEMORIES LIKE FLASH-MEMORIES.
is a special case of software decay, which is about non-updated software starting to malfunction when its environment changes.
is a type of malware that spreads only slowly and only to computers nearby.


**The "track changes" feature of a word processor with its change logs is good for integrity, but can produce problems, the most dangerous of which is a threat relating to
performance.

_________________________________ Storage security basics
**Which of the following is the worst answer to the question: "Do databases need more fine-grained access control than that offered by the operating system of the machine containing the database?"?
No, if you don't need to differentiate between database users.
NO, IF ALL DATABASE INFORMATION IS PUBLIC.
Yes, if user separation at the file permissions level is not enough.
Usually needed.

**The purpose of the operating system is NOT to combat the integrity problem that threatens the database in the situation, where
a user level process of a hacker attempting to write to the memory area used by the database manager.
TWO USERS UPDATING THE DATABASE READ THE SAME INFORMATION FROM THE DATABASE AT THE SAME TIME.
simultaneous users start the database management program in two or more separate processes.
the data transfer gets out of sync between the main memory of the database machine and the peripheral memory.


**Historically encryption was invented to protect data in transit, i.e. messages. To protect data in storage
the same procedures apply by replacing the transmission channel with the storage media and equalling recipient = sender.
stronger and faster cryptography is needed because of the high volume of data.
VARIOUS NEW QUESTIONS ARISE, LIKE WHETHER TO ENCRYPT FILES, FILE SYSTEMS OR WHOLE STORAGE MEDIA.
simpler algorithms with shorter key lengths suffice because there is no real-time demand and the attack surface is smaller.


**What can go wrong more likely than the other options if your computer automatically saves your data files in a cloud service?
If your computer breaks down, you cannot access your files any more.
If you lose your computer, somebody else can boot it from external media and access your files.
The service provider cracks the encryption on your files.
YOU LOSE YOUR CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS THE FILES.
