**Besides a physical meaning the concept of access control is defined as "The process of granting or denying specific requests to obtain and use information and related information processing services". What is the significance of the word "specific" here?
It denotes the fact that not all requests are submitted to the granting/denying process.
Without that word the defined scope would be overly large, covering all levels from the OS kernel to the application layer.
Omitting the word would not change the meaning, because all requests of the defined kind are specific in some sense.
IT LIMITS THE SCOPE OF ACCESS CONTROL TO THE MOMENT WHEN THE REQUEST HAPPENS - IN CONTRAST TO THE POLICY LEVEL THAT TELLS HOW THE GRANTING/DENYING PROCESS SHOULD WORK.


**Investigate the claim: As a security goal, Availability, or Usability, means that information or services are stored and accessible sooner or later. It is false because
the term usability should not be used in the same sense as the term availability.
AVAILABILITY REQUIRES THAT THE DATA BE ACCESSED WITHIN A SET TIME LIMIT.
in terms of security, availability only applies to information and usability only to services.
usability also requires that the data have not changed uncontrollably.


**Identity is a profound concept in information systems. Count how many of the following operations can be done to it: Identity can be (i) offered as a service, (ii) changed, (iii) confiscated, (iv) stolen, (v) verified (vi) spoofed.
