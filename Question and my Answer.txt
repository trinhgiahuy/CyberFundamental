-----------------------Data Packet
Data is transmitted in packets, which consist of a payload and a header in IPv4. 
The payload is the data itself that is being transmitted, while the header includes the type of protocol, addresses and other information needed
to make sure that the data can arrive at its desired location.





What is TLS (Transport Layer Security)
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Transport-Layer-Security-TLS
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides authentication, privacy, and data integrity between two communicating computer applications. 
It's the most widely-deployed security protocol used today and is used for web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network,
such as web browsing sessions, file transfers, VPN connections, remote desktop sessions, and voice over IP (VoIP)


Difference between IPSec and SSL
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ipsec-and-ssl/?ref=rp
It is a networking protocol that is used at the transport layer to provide a secure connection between the client and the server over the internet
SSL is used to secure web transactions while IPSec used to secure VPN 
for eg : SSL is used for securing communication between web browser and web server

https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Shell
SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, 
a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

Basically, The protocol and program of choice for setting up a window for command line use of a remote computer
	


	
----------------------------------------------					DMZ (Networking)
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/DMZ

In computer networks, a DMZ (demilitarized zone), also sometimes known as a perimeter network or a screened subnetwork,
is a physical or logical subnet that separates an internal local area network (LAN) from other untrusted networks
-- usually the public internet. External-facing servers, resources and services are located in the DMZ. 
Therefore, they are accessible from the internet, but the rest of the internal LAN remains unreachable. 
This provides an additional layer of security to the LAN as it restricts a hacker's ability to directly access internal servers and data through the internet.
	

Most common server that provide to the users on the public internet should be place in DMZ network such as : web server, proxy server,server for email, domain name system (DNS), File transfet protocol (FTP) , voice over IP(VoIP)

-----------------------------------------					Packet fitering 			//an effective defense against attacks from computers outside a local area network (LAN).
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4038/packet-filtering
Packet filtering is a firewall technique used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets 
and allowing them to pass or halt based on the source and destination Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, protocols and ports.
	
Packet filtering checks source and destination IP addresses. If both IP addresses match, the packet is considered secure and verified.
packet filtering also checks source and destination protocols, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). 
Packet filters also verify source and destination port addresses.

*The tasks of a packet filter may include
user authentication.
anti-virus.
spam filtering.
??WRITING LOGS.						///what is writting logs



------------------------------------------				Router 
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2277/router
A router is a device that analyzes the contents of data packets transmitted within a network or to another network. 
Routers determine whether the source and destination are on the same network or whether data must be transferred from one network type to another,
which requires encapsulating the data packet with routing protocol header information for the new network type.



------------------------------------				Public key infrastructure (PKI)
https://www.ssh.com/pki/

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world.
The basic idea is to have one or more trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device. 
The key can then be used as an identity for the user in digital networks.

The users and devices that have keys are often just called entities. The purpose of a PKI is to securely associate a key with an entity.
The trusted party signing the document associating the key with the device is called a certificate authority (CA). 
The certificate authority also has a cryptographic key that it uses for signing these documents. 
These documents are called certificates.

--------------------------------First concepts [ < General < Information and... ]

*What is required of an attack to be regarded as a cyber attack?

The target is not a private person using a single computer.
The attack happens on behalf of a nation state.
+THE TARGET SUFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS.
The attacker is not acting alone but in a large coherent group.



*Denial of service is a term

for a specific attack where the attacker modifies the responses from a www server to display http 404.
used of any situations where the user or a process is not granted the service he, she or it would be authorized to get.
+THAT REFERS TO A SERVICE NOT BEING ABLE TO OPERATE BECAUSE OF MALICIOUS REQUESTS.
used mainly of such situations where a cracked service has been taken down for repair by administrators.

*What makes a denial of service attack (DoS) a distributed DoS?
There are many hackers working in consort to gain access to the attacked service.
The attacked server spreads the unavailability to a large community of other servers and services.
The whole farm of load-balancing and resilience-providing computers are attacked to make the service unavailable.
+THE ATTACKING TRAFFIC COMES TO THE SERVER FROM SEVERAL COMPUTERS SIMULTANEOUSLY.


*The term attack vector
+IS JUST A MORE FANCY WAY OF REFERRING TO A PARTICULAR ATTACK THAT HAS HAPPENED.
refers to the attacker's point of view to the chain of protections that implement the defence-in-depth approach.
refers to the method of an attack - one that happened or is possible.
refers to the combination of all vulnerabilities that exist in a particular information system.



*Confidentiality is one of the three basic goals ("C-I-A") of information security,

but it is hardly ever as important as integrity.
and it is always always more important than availability.
but it is usually not sufficient without integrity and availability.
and lack of confidentiality would lead to similar problems as lack of either integrity or availability.



---------------------------Some victims and attackers [ < Personal aspect... < Information and... ]
//In short, Script Kiddie is a newbie type of hacker without any solid programming knowledge 
who uses the existing codes and scripts to gain illegal access into a computer system or network and even a website.
*The term script kiddie is used for certain types of attackers. What is typical of them from a defender's perspective?		

Essentially similar scripts to other attackers.
Unpredictably modified scripts, which can therefore be particularly dangerous.
They cannot be held because they are minors.
+YOUTH AND INCOMPETENCE, WHICH IS WHY THEIR ATTACKS ARE NOT VERY DANGEROUS.


*Attackers that are called script kiddies are characterized by

+USING SCRIPTS WRITTEN BY OTHERS.
acting as apprentices and assistants to more experienced actors.
underage and immature morality.
installing malicious software on the machines of several other users from which the attack continues automatically.


*Identity theft
//Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name 
and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss.
+HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE MALICIOUSLY USES IDENTIFYING DATA OF ANOTHER PERSON.
means that an attacker changes someones credentials at a service so that the victim is blocked out.
is never a theft of identity alone; it also involves causing some loss or other disadvantage to the owner.
can happen accidentally, i.e. someone can end up stealing someone else's identity without intending to do so.


*There are many digitals entities that spread mainly by the forwarding action of people. Some of them are not direct risks to computing.
How many of that kind of user-spread entities are in this list: spam, hoax, RANSOMWARE, MEME VIRUS, NIGERIAN LETTER, TROLL?

*All of the following attacks have some social aspect, but which description gives the best coverage for the concept of social engineering?

SOLICITING SENSITIVE PERSONAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION BY PERSUASIVE OR MASQUERADING EMAILS.
Inferring sensitive personal or organizational information from discarded papers and media together with public sources.
Getting physically close and even familiar to people in order to see what they input as credentials to information systems.
Exercising the art of influencing people to act against their security policy.


*Successful impersonation means that
an identity has been confiscated.
a new identity has been assigned to a user.
a new role has been assigned to a user.
SOMEBODY/SOMETHING HAS BEEN CHEATED TO ACT AS IF HE/IT IS IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE ELSE THAN THE ATTACKER.

------------------------------				PHISHING ATTACKS
Phishing attackers pretend to be a trusted institution or individual in an attempt to persuade you to expose personal data and other valuables.
Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details, 
by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.[1][2] Typically carried out by email spoofing,
[3] instant messaging,[4] and text messaging, phishing often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website which matches the look and feel of the legitimate site.[5]

	
Attacks using phishing are targeted in one of two ways:

+SPAM PHISHING, or mass phishing, is a widespread attack aimed at many users. These attacks are non-personalized and try to catch any unsuspecting person.
+SPEAR PHISHING and by extension, whaling , use personalized info to target particular users. 
Whaling attacks specifically aim at high-value targets like celebrities, upper management, and high government officials.

-------------------------------				Honest but curious
The honest-but-curious (HBC) adversary is a legitimate participant in a communication protocol who will not deviate from the defined protocol 
but will attempt to learn all possible information from legitimately received messages

--------------------------------			INTRUDER
In relation to computers, an intruder is an individual or software program that enters a computer system without authorization.
An example of an intruder would be a hacker. Another example would be a software virus.

--------------------------------			Eavesdropper	(nghe lén)
https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/what-is-eavesdropping-in-computer-security#:~:text=The%20term%20%27eavesdropping%27%20is%20used%20to%20refer%20to,great%20significance%20in%20the%20world%20of%20cyber%20security.
The term 'eavesdropping' is used to refer to the interception of communication between two parties by a malicious third party. Since the beginning of the digital age, 
the term has also come to hold great significance in the world of cyber security.

Method of eavesdropping:
Hackers are constantly coming up with new ways to eavesdrop on digital conversations. Voice-over-IP calls which are made using IP-based communication are recorded with the help of protocol analyzers. 
The data can be converted into audio files to be analyzed by the hacker.


Another popular eavesdropping method is DATA SNIFFING. This technique works well on LOCAL NETWORKs which make use of a HUB. Since all the communications within the network are sent to all the ports of the network,
all a sniffer has to do is choose to accept every bit of incoming data, even though they were not the intended recipients. 
Wireless networking data can be similarly manipulated if it broadcasts unsecured information to all the network ports.


---------------------------				Backdoor
In the world of cybersecurity, a backdoor refers to any method by which authorized and unauthorized users are able to get around normal security measures and gain high level user access (aka root access)
on a computer system, network, or software application.


[Wiki]A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, 
or even a "homunculus computer" —a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology).



------------------------------		Dictionary attack
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/dictionary-attack

A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password.
A dictionary attack can also be used in an attempt to find the key necessary to decrypt an encrypted message or document.
rarely successful against systems that employ multiple-word phrases, and unsuccessful against systems that employ random combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters mixed up with numerals. 
In those systems, the brute-force method of attack (in which every possible combination of characters and spaces is tried up to a certain maximum length) can sometimes be effective,
although this approach can take a long time to produce results.



--------------------------------		Passive attack & Active attack
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-active-attack-and-passive-attack/?ref=rp
Passive attacks: A Passive attack attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. Passive Attacks are in the nature of eavesdropping on or monitoring of transmission. 
The goal of the opponent is to obtain information is being transmitted. Types of Passive attacks are as following:



Active Attacks:
Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. 
Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.

Passive Attacks:
Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. 
Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack

------------------------------------		Malware
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection/what-is-malware.html

https://security4web.org/page.php?id=10
Malware is intrusive software that is designed to damage and destroy computers and computer systems. Malware is a contraction for “malicious software.” 
Examples of common malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware

Malware is a computer software that usually installs itself on your computer unknowingly.
It is the compound from malicious and software (malware), a generic term used to describe all kinds of malicious software.
It refers to worms, viruses, trojans, spyware, adware, hoaxes, etc., and it was designed to damage or disrupt a computer system.

------------------------------------		Ransomware						//a kind of malware
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/security/ransomware-defense/what-is-ransomware.html

Ransomware is a type of malicious software, also known as malware. It encrypts a victim’s data until the attacker is paid a predetermined ransom. Typically, the attacker demands payment in a form of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. 
Only then will the attacker send a decryption key to release the victim’s data.
A number of ransomware variants have appeared in recent years, which we’ll describe in greater detail below. We will also explain how you can protect your system against future attacks.


-------------------------------------			Maintainance Hook
Maintenance hook: A trapdoor in software that allows easy maintenance and development of additional features and that may allow entry into the program at unusual points or without the usual checks
Since maintenance hooks frequently allow entry into the code without the usual checks, they are a serious security risk if they are not removed prior to live implementation."[2]


------------------------------------			Rootkit 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/rootkits-malware

Malware authors use rootkits to hide malware on your device, allowing malware to persist as long as possible.
A successful rootkit can potentially remain in place for years if it is undetected. During this time it will steal information and resources.
Rootkits intercept and change standard operating system processes. After a rootkit infects a device, you can’t trust any information that device reports about itself.
The term "rootkit" has negative connotations through its association with malware.[1]



-----------------------------				Buffer Overflow
https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/buffer-overflow/
Buffers are memory storage regions that temporarily hold data while it is being transferred from one location to another. 
A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. 
As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent(liền kề) memory locations.


----------------------------				Exposure
Exposure definition

An exposure is a state in a computing system (or set of systems) which is not a universal vulnerability, but either:
Allows an attacker to conduct information gathering activities or to hide activities
Allows an attacker to hide activities Includes a capability that behaves as expected,
but can be easily compromised Is a primary point of entry that an attacker may attempt to use to gain access to the system or data Is considered a problem according to some reasonable security policy .


-----------------------					Macro Virus
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/macro-virus

A macro virus is a computer virus written in the same macro language used for software programs, including Microsoft Excel or word processors such as Microsoft Word. 
When a macro virus infects a software application, it causes a sequence of actions to begin automatically when the application is opened.
Since a macro virus centers on an APPLICATION AND NOT AN OPERATING SYSTEM, it typically can infect any computer running any operating system, even those running MacOS and Linux.


https://security4web.org/glossary.php?w=Macro%20virus
Macro virus definition

A program or code segment written in the internal macro language of an application. Some macros replicate, while others infect documents.

-------------------------				Trojan horseIn 
https://softwarelab.org/what-is-a-trojan-horse/#:~:text=In%20cybersecurity%20terms%2C%20a%20Trojan%20horse%20is%20a,is%20usually%20disguised%20as%20a%20legitimate%20computer%20program.
cybersecurity terms, a Trojan horse is a piece of malware that can damage, steal, or otherwise harm your data or your computer network. Often referred to simply as a Trojan, this malicious software is usually disguised as a legitimate computer program. Once downloaded and installed on your system,
it allows hackers to spy on your online activity, access and copy files from your hard drive, modify and delete your data, hamper the performance of your computer, and even steal your personal information.



--------------------------				Zero day
https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-how-do-zero-day-vulnerabilities-work-30sectech.html
A zero-day vulnerability is a software security flaw that is known to the software vendor but doesn’t have a patch in place to fix the flaw. It has the potential to be exploited by cybercriminals.

The term “zero-day” refers to A NEWLY DISCOVERED SOFTWARE VULNERABILITY. Because the developer has just learned of the flaw, it also means an official patch or update to fix the issue hasn’t been released.
So, “zero-day” refers to the fact that the developers have “zero days” to fix the problem that has just been exposed — and perhaps already exploited by hackers.
Once the vulnerability becomes publicly known, the vendor has to work quickly to fix the issue to protect its users.
But the software vendor may fail to release a patch before hackers manage to exploit the security hole. That’s known as a zero-day attack.

https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/zero-day-vulnerability


------------------------- 					Worms and Virus
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/macro-virus
Worms and viruses behave differently, as they can quickly proliferate and undermine an entire computer system. They also may perform unsavory activities from a user’s computer without the user’s knowledge. 
In the wake of a virus or worm, a computer system can experience significant damage.



------------------------					DRM protection
https://www.dvdfab.cn/resource/drm/drm-protection
DRM, the abbreviation of Digital Rights Management, is a copyright protection scheme that controls the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted materials. 
DRM protection restricts the actions of using, modifying and distributing of copyrighted works like software, video files, ebooks, songs, games, documents, etc.


------------------------------				Man in the middle attack (MITM)
https://www.avg.com/en/signal/man-in-the-middle-attack#:~:text=A%20Man-in-the-middle%20attack%20is%20a%20generic%20name%20for,box%20where%20you%20enter%20your%20payment%20details%20

MITM attacks allow hackers to intercept, send and receive data to and from your device undetected until the transaction is complete.
2 steps for attacking
Step 1: Interception	: The first order of business for Man-In-The-Middlers is to intercept your internet traffic before it reaches its destination. There are a few methods to get this done:
Step 2: Decryption		: Once hackers have intercepted your web traffic, they have to decrypt it. Here are some common decryption methods used in MITM attacks:

https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/man-in-the-middle-attacks/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Man-in-the-Middle%20%28MITM%29%20Attack%3F%20Man-in-the-middle%20attacks,conversation%20they%20should%20normally%20not%20be%20able%20
 Eve could then gather information from this, alter the response,  and pass the message along to Bob (who thinks he’s talking to Alice). As a result, Eve is able to transparently hijack their conversation.	

----------------------------------				Botnets
https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-a-botnet.html
Botnets are the workhorses of the Internet. They’re connected computers performing a number of repetitive tasks to keep websites going. 
It’s most often used in connection with Internet Relay Chat. These types of botnets are entirely legal and even beneficial to maintaining a smooth user experience on the Internet.


Careful with malicious botnet.What happens is that botnets gain access to your machine through some piece of malicious coding. In some cases, your machine is directly hacked,
while other times what is known as a “spider” (a program that crawls the Internet looking for holes in security to exploit) does the hacking automatically.
More often than not, what botnets are looking to do is to add your computer to their web. That usually happens through a drive-by download or fooling you into installing a Trojan horse on your computer. 
Once the software is downloaded, the botnet will now contact its master computer and let it know that everything is ready to go. 
Now your computer, phone or tablet is entirely under the control of the person who created the botnet.


Common tasks executed by botnets include:

Using your machine’s power to assist in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to shut down websites.
Emailing spam out to millions of Internet users.
Generating fake Internet traffic on a third-party website for financial gain.
Replacing banner ads in your web browser specifically targeted at you.

Botnets are networks of hijacked computer devices used to carry out various scams and cyberattacks. The term “botnet” is formed from the word’s “robot” and “network.”
Assembly of a botnet is usually the infiltration stage of a multi-layer scheme. The bots serve as a tool to automate mass attacks, such as data theft, server crashing, and malware distribution.




------------------------------------------					Security Assurance
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/security-assurance#:~:text=Security%20assurance%20is%20the%20guarantee%20provided%20with%20regard,over%20time%20as%20users%20interact%20with%20an%20application.
Security assurance is the guarantee provided with regard to access control, security privileges, and enforcement over time as users interact with an application.
For a big-data application that shares and exchanges information from multiple sources in different formats, security assurance must reconcile local security capabilities to meet stakeholder needs. 





------------------------------------------					What is non-repudiation?
https://www.cryptomathic.com/products/authentication-signing/digital-signatures-faqs/what-is-non-repudiation#:~:text=Non-repudiation%20is%20a%20legal%20concept%20that%20is%20widely,as%20the%20authenticity%20and%20integrity%20of%20that%20message.
Non-repudiation is a legal concept that is widely used in information security and refers to a service, which provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of the data. 
In other words, non-repudiation makes it very difficult to successfully deny who/where a message came from as well as the authenticity and integrity of that message.

Digital signatures (combined with other measures) can offer non-repudiation when it comes to online transactions

Non-repudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something.
https://www.computer-security-glossary.org/non-repudiation.html
Non-Repudiation is associated with verifying the identities of individuals or companies who are participating in an on-line transaction.
The main purpose of authenticating identities online is to prevent one party or the other from denying the transaction.
One of the techniques used to provide the authenticity of the transaction is the use of digital signatures. 
It makes possible the assurance that a particular individual participated in a specific transaction.

To repudiate means to deny or contest something. Therefore, non-repudiation must be the ability to ensure that someone cannot deny or contest that thing.
This is usually seen in electronic communications where one party cannot be confirmed as the recipient or denies seeing or signing a contract or document. 
Non-repudiation means putting measures in place that will prevent one party from denying they received or agreed to a transaction.

--------------------			Digital Signature
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature
A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document. 
As the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, a digital signature offers far more inherent security, 
and it is intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation in digital communications.

Digital signatures are based on public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. 
Using a public key algorithm, such as RSA, one can generate two keys that are mathematically linked: one private and one public.

------------------------------				Certificate authority (CA)
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/certificate-authority
A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates, which are data files used to cryptographically link an entity with a public key.
Certificate authorities are a critical part of the internet's public key infrastructure (PKI) 
because they issue the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates that web browsers use to authenticate content sent from web servers.

https://www.omnisecu.com/security/public-key-infrastructure/what-is-a-certificate-authority-ca.php#:~:text=Certificate%20Authority%20%28CA%29%20is%20a%20trusted%20entity%20that,fact%2C%20who%20he%20or%20she%20claims%20to%20be.
Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues Digital Certificates and public-private key pairs. 
The role of the Certificate Authority (CA) is to guarantee that the individual granted the unique certificate is, in fact, who he or she claims to be.
A Certificate Authority (CA) performs the following functions.

-Certificate Authority (CA) Verifies the identity: The Certificate Authority (CA) must validate the identity of the entity who requested a digital certificate before issuing it.

-Certificate Authority (CA) issues digital certificates: Once the validation process is over, the Certificate Authority (CA) issues the digital certificate to the entity who requsted it.
Digital certificates can be used for encryption (Example: Encrypting web traffic), code signing, authentocation etc.

-Certificate Authority (CA) maintains Certificate Revocation List (CRL): The Certificate Authority (CA) maintains Certificate Revocation List (CRL). 
A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list of digital certificates which are no longer valid and have been revoked and therefore should not be relied by anyone.

In information security, challenge-response authentication is a type of authentication protocol where one entity presents a challenge or question, and another entity provides a valid response to be authenticated. Challenge-response authentication is a type of authentication method used to prove the identity of a user or other entity  requesting access to a computer, network or other network resource. 
This method uses previously answered challenge questions to authenticate the user; simple user ID and password authentication is the most commonly implemented type of challenge-response system.

----------------------------				Private key
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/private-key
A private key, also known as a secret key, is a variable in cryptography that is used with an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt code. 
Secret keys are only shared with the key’s generator, making it highly secure. Private keys play an important role in symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography and cryptocurrencies.

The complexity and length of the private key determine how feasible it is for an interloper to carry out a brute force attack and try out different keys until the right one is found.

------------------------------------				Non-disclosure, but public keys. [ < Techniques < Organizations ]

------------------non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nda.asp
A non-disclosure agreement is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship. 
The party or parties signing the agreement agree that sensitive information they may obtain will not be made available to any others.
Non-disclosure agreements are common for businesses entering into negotiations with other businesses. They allow the parties to share sensitive information without fear that it will end up in the hands of competitors.
In this case, it may be called a mutual non-disclosure agreement.
-------------------


*A non-disclosure agreement may have many forms, but its usual purpose is
to protect the customer's or employee's personal data against too wide usage by the organization.
+TO PREVENT AN EMPLOYEE OR VISITOR FROM REVEALING SENSITIVE INFORMATION OF AN ORGANIZATION.
to provide a confidentiality classification of information that an organization shares with its members.
to set rules for encryption for sensitive data of an organization.

*The basic goal of a public key infrastructure is to
bind a private key to a corresponding public key.
+BIND THE PUBLIC KEY TO THE ENTITY TO WHICH THE KEY BELONGS.
allow for a reasonably short and easy-to-find chain of certificates.
enable a wide user base by using a hierarchical structure.

----------------------------public key certificate
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/public-key-certificate
There are different types of public key certificates for different functions, such as authorization for a specific action or delegation of authority. 
Public key certificates are part of a public key infrastructure that deals with digitally signed documents.
The other components are public key encryption, trusted third parties (such as the certification authority), and mechanisms for certificate publication and issuing

Document consists of a specially formatted block of data that contains the name of the certificate holder (which may be either a user or a system name) and the holder's public key, 
as well as the digital signature of a certification authority for authentication.
*Assume K is a public key and S is the corresponding private key, and they belong to person B. A certificate for K is generated when
+SOMEONE ELSE USES HIS PRIVATE KEY FOR A SIGNATURE THAT BINDS K AND THE IDENTITY OF B.				//certificate for public key deal with digitally signed document
using S, a signature is calculated that binds K and S.
a trusted party creates a digital signature that binds K with S.
a signature is created which can be verified with S and which binds the identity of B to K.





----------------------------					Password [ < Access < Secure practice... ]

*If you need to come up with a question and answer in a web service for the case of forgetting your password, which of the following is most important from the authentication point of view?
the memorability of the answer
the entropy of the answer
the entropy of the question
the compatibility of the question and the answer

*If your browser offers you the option to save for future use the password you just entered for some web service, which of the following conditions is most important for you to accept the offer?
There is nothing valuable behind the password.
You do not need the password from any other machine.
The passwords in your browser are protected from others.
The password is so entropic that you would not be able to remember it.

*The instructions concerning the use of a password can be condensed into five prohibitions: Do not (i) show, (ii) tell, (iii) save, (iv) allow to age, (v) recycle. In the case of a personal password, you must not bargain on some points, whereas you can do it on others. Which of the following mentions first a prohibition that you must not and then one that you can relax?
(ii) & (iii)
(iii) & (iv)
(i) & (ii)
(iv) & (v)

*Which of the following is generally the most dangerous with passwords? The user
uses the same password in several places.
selects a password with low entropy.
never changes his password.
writes the password on paper.
It has been said of the password that it should be treated like your own toothbrush. How many of the following password-related features does this statement represent? (i) Entropy, (ii) usability, (iii) keeping it for personal use only, (iv) changing it often enough.
none
two

--------------------------					Captcha [ < Simplifying com... < Secure practice... ]
https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/panda-security/what-is-captcha/

*CAPTCHA or "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"
is a security mechanism that, by definition, cannot be attacked by human force.
+IS AN EXAMPLE OF AUTHENTICATION THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE IDENTIFICATION.
cannot be interpreted as authentication.
is authentication based on either knowledge, ownership, or location.

*Why would you bother to write your email address in the form of john.doePOISTA@MINUTtuni.fi? ("Poista minut" is Finnish for "Remove me".)
+TO AVOID SPAMMERS HARVESTING YOUR REAL ADDRESS SO EASILY.
To announce your desire to get away from a mailing list.
To hide your domain (location) from automatic scanning by authorities.
To prevent excessive contacts from others than those who know Finnish.


-------------------------------			Crypto procedures [ < Crypto concepts < Crypto ]

*Cryptographic primitives are mainly
such basic mechanisms, that can be found in all cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
prime numbers from which keys are formed.
procedures that a cryptology practitioner can view like indivisible blocks.
base numbers that generate all other numbers in modular arithmetic.

*Which of the following is mainly a task that can be performed using a cryptographic protocol?
Secure storage of an encryption key.
Converting an email message to ciphertext.
Generating an encryption key based on good random numbers.
+AGREEING ON AN ENCRYPTION KEY.

*Investigate the argument: Crypto algorithms are either symmetric encryption algorithms, or asymmetric encryption or signature algorithms. It is
+FALSE BECAUSE THE LIST LACKS ALGORITHMS THAT DO NOT USE A KEY.
true, because the digital signature that has been introduced alongside the traditional encryption is done with an encryption-like algorithm, which is not symmetric.
false, but the inclusion of steganography would make the claim true.
true, because it does not make sense to mention separately decryption or signature verification.

*Which of the following is not covered by the concept of a cryptographic algorithm?
message authentication code
+CHALLENGE-RESPONSE METHOD
hash function
random number generator
