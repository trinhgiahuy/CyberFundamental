_______________________________________________________ Subject and Object
The subject is a something that can manipulate an object; an object is something that can be manipulated by a subject.

A subject is usually a human user or process running in memory.

An object is any resource that exists anywhere a subject can access it (in memory, on disk, across a communications channel, in "the cloud", etc.).

Subjects are active and objects are passive.











Denial of service becomes more possible
if the service is distributed to many sites that must occasionally synchronize their data.
if the service can be accessed through several addresses, some of which can be administratively blocked in case of too many requests.
IF THE SECURITY POLICY DICTATES THAT TOO MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS TO LOG IN LEAD TO A TEMPORARY LOCK-OUT.
if the authentication of clients requires a proof-of-effort from them.

Three of these five: Ping of Death, Ping sweep, Smurf, Spyware and SYN flood, are examples of attacks directly against

---------------------------------advanced persistent threat (APT)
https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/advanced-persistent-threat-APT#:~:text=Some%20examples%20of%20advanced%20persistent%20threats%20include%3A%201,cybersecurity%20researchers%20in%202010.%20...%20More%20items...%20

An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a prolonged and targeted cyberattack in which an intruder gains access to a network and REMAINS UNDETECTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.
APT attacks are initiated to steal data rather than cause damage to the target organization's network.

APT groups often use advanced attack methods, including advanced exploits of zero-day vulnerabilities, as well as highly-targeted spear phishing and other social engineering techniques.

maintain access to the targeted network without being discovered, threat actors use advanced methods, including continuously rewriting malicious code to avoid detection and other sophisticated evasion techniques
------------------------
Salami attack: A salami attack is a small attack that can be repeated many times very efficiently. Thus the combined output of the attack is great.
In the example above, it refers to stealing the round-off from interest in bank accounts.
Even though it is less than 1 cent per account, when multiplied by millions of accounts over many months, the adversary can retrieve quite a large amount.

------------------------			What is baiting 
Baiting is like the real-world ‘Trojan Horse’. Therefore it uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim. It’s in many ways similar to phishing attacks.
However, what distinguishes them from other types of social engineering is the promise of an item or good that hackers use to entice victims.

------------------------------	What is shoulder surfing
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4103/shoulder-surfing
act of obtaining personal or private information through direct observation. Shoulder surfing involves looking over a person's shoulder to gather pertinent information while the victim is oblivious.


----------------------------		Side channel attack

A side-channel attack (SCA) is a security exploit that involves collecting information about what a computing device does when it is performing cryptographic operations and using that information to reverse engineer the device's cryptography system.
---------------------------			What is an internet troll
https://www.howtogeek.com/465416/what-is-an-internet-troll-and-how-to-handle-trolls/
An internet troll is someone who makes intentionally inflammatory, rude, or upsetting statements online to elicit strong emotional responses in people or to steer the conversation off-topic.
They can come in many forms. Most trolls do this for their own amusement, but other forms of trolling are done to push a specific agenda.

Instead of targeting a software vulnerability caused by a coding error or configuration drift, the attacker exploits the way the device's operating system (OS) accesses the hardware upon which the OS runs


--------------------------------	Meet in the middle attack
https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/meet-in-the-middle-attack
Meet-in-the-middle is a known attack that can exponentially reduce the number of brute force permutations required to decrypt text that has been encrypted by more than one key. 
Such an attack makes it much easier for an intruder to gain access to data.
The meet-in-the-middle attack targets block cipher cryptographic functions. The intruder applies brute force techniques to both the plaintext and ciphertext of a block cipher.

Although a meet-in-the-middle exploit can make the attacker's job easier, it can't be conducted without a piece of plaintext and corresponding ciphertex
--------------------------		Birthday attack in Cryptography
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/birthday-attack-in-cryptography/
Birthday attack is a type of cryptographic attack that belongs to a class of brute force attacks. It exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory.

Birthday paradox problem –

----------------------------		Ping of death attack (POD)
https://www.imperva.com/learn/ddos/ping-of-death/
Ping of Death (a.k.a. PoD) is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker attempts to crash, destabilize, or freeze the targeted computer or service by sending malformed or oversized packets using a simple ping command.
While PoD attacks exploit legacy weaknesses which may have been patched in target systems. However, in an unpatched systems, the attack is still relevant and dangerous.
Recently, a new type of PoD attack has become popular. 

------------------------------		What is injection attack 
https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/injection-attacks/
Injection attacks refer to a broad class of attack vectors.
In an injection attack, an attacker supplies untrusted input to a program. This input gets processed by an interpreter as part of a command or query. 
In turn, this alters the execution of that program.
Injections are amongst the oldest and most dangerous attacks aimed at web applications. 
They can lead to data theft, data loss, loss of data integrity, denial of service, as well as full system compromise. 
The primary reason for injection vulnerabilities is usually insufficient user input validation.

SQL injection (SQLi) and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) are the most common injection attacks but they are not the only ones.

---------------------------		Cross-site script 
https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/cross-site-scripting-xss/
Cross-site Scripting, also known as XSS, is a way of bypassing the SOP concept in a vulnerable web application. 
Whenever HTML code is generated dynamically, and the user input is not sanitized and is reflected on the page an attacker could insert his own HTML code. 
The web browser will still show the user's code since it pertains to the website where it is injected.

In such case an attacker can easily insert JavaScript code which would run under the site's context. 
By doing so the attacker is able to access other pages on the same domain and can read data like CSRF-Tokens or the set cookie


---------------------------	Intrusion Detection Attack
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3988/intrusion-detection-system-ids#:~:text=An%20intrusion%20detection%20system%20%28IDS%29%20is%20a%20type,through%20malicious%20activities%20or%20through%20security%20policy%20violations.
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a type of security software designed to automatically alert administrators 
when someone or something is trying to compromise information system through malicious activities or through security policy violations.

-----------------------------			Federated Identity (FID)
https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/federation-and-sso/federated-identity/

A Federated Identity is an attestation produced by an authenticating party that verifies the identity of an access-requesting party to a third party.

Also : Difference btw FID and SSO:
Federated Identity on the other hand is a solution used across enterprises, or independently managed domains within an enterprise. 
It requires that two or more federated identity systems establish trust amongst themselves, 
to allow one identity federation party to attest to another about the identity of an access-requesting party

https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/cryptanalysis

Cryptanalysis is the study of ciphertext, ciphers and cryptosystems with the aim of understanding how they work and finding and improving techniques for defeating or weakening them

_______________________________________________________ Confussion and Difussion

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion

Confusion means that each binary digit (bit) of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring the connections between the two.
The property of confusion hides the relationship between the CIPHERTEXT AND THE KEY.
This property makes it difficult to find the key from the ciphertext and if a single bit in a key is changed, the calculation of the values of most or all of the bits in the ciphertext will be affected.
Confusion increases the ambiguity of ciphertext and it is used by both block and stream ciphers.


Diffusion means that if we change a single bit of the plaintext, then (statistically) half of the bits in the ciphertext should change, and similarly, if we change one bit of the ciphertext, then approximately one half of the plaintext bits should change.[2] Since a bit can have only two states, when they are all re-evaluated and changed from one seemingly random position to another, half of the bits will have changed state.
The idea of diffusion is to hide the relationship between the CIPHERTEXT AND THE PLAIN TEXT.
This will make it hard for an attacker who tries to find out the plain text and it increases the redundancy of plain text by spreading it across the rows and columns; it is achieved through transposition of algorithm and it is used by block ciphers only.

_______________________________________________________ Chosen-plaintext attack
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack

A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis which presumes that the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts for arbitrary plaintexts.[1] 
The goal of the attack is to gain information that reduces the security of the encryption scheme.
Modern ciphers aim to provide semantic security, also known as ciphertext indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack, 
and are therefore by design generally immune to chosen-plaintext attacks if correctly implemented.

_______________________________________________________ Key escrow
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow

Key escrow (also known as a “fair” cryptosystem) is an arrangement in which the keys needed to decrypt encrypted data are held in escrow so that, 
under certain circumstances, an authorized third party may gain access to those keys
